<h1> [CS572] Team 3 Intelligent-Robotics Final Project  </h1>
<h2> Job Shop Scheduling Problems with Reinforcement Learning </h2>


The project has three points of view.
<ul>
  <li> First, we compare existing algorithms with Reinforcement Learning.</li>
  <li>Second, compare the characteristics for Q-network and  <a href = https://www.readcube.com/articles/10.1038%2Fnature14236?shared_access_token=Lo_2hFdW4MuqEcF3CVBZm9RgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0P5kedCCNjz3FJ2FhQCgXkApOr3ZSsJAldp-tw3IWgTseRnLpAc9xQq-vTA2Z5Ji9lg16_WvCy4SaOgpK5XXA6ecqo8d8J7l4EJsdjwai53GqKt-7JuioG0r3iV67MQIro74l6IxvmcVNKBgOwiMGi8U0izJStLpmQp6Vmi_8Lw_A%3D%3D> Deep Q-network (DQN).</a></li>
  <li> Third, we analyze the performance of DQN according to the size of the problem by addressing the 3x3 problem and the larger 5x4 job shop scheduling problem.
</li></ul>


The source code consists of two folders. The 3by3 folder contains the code for the job shop scheduling problem with three machines and three jobs. The 5by4 folder contains the code for the problem with five machines and four jobs.
